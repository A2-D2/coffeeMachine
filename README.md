## Stage 1/6: Hello, coffee!

Writing a program that puts basic information on the screen: giving the machine a chance to tell the customers what itâ€™s doing!

## Stage 2/6: Machines have needs 

Programming the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

## Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone

Working with conditions, programming the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

## Stage 4/6: Action!

Utilising my knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

## Stage 5/6: On a coffee loop

Programming the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.

## Stage 6/6: Brush your code

Final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
